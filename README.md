1. **Steep Learning Curve**: React requires understanding of JSX, state management, and component lifecycle, which can be challenging for beginners.
2. **Boilerplate Code**: React often requires writing a lot of boilerplate code for setting up components and state management.
3. **SEO Challenges**: React applications can face issues with search engine optimization (SEO) if not properly configured with server-side rendering (SSR).
4. **Fast-Paced Development**: The React ecosystem evolves rapidly, making it hard to keep up with new tools and best practices.
5. **Dependency on External Libraries**: React often requires additional libraries for routing, state management, and other functionalities, increasing complexity.
6. **Overhead for Small Applications**: For small projects, React might be overkill due to its setup and complexity.
7. **JSX Syntax**: JSX can be confusing for developers who are not familiar with combining HTML and JavaScript in the same file.
8. **Performance Issues**: Improper handling of state and props can lead to performance bottlenecks in large applications.
